    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this exploratory analysis is to ascertain whether Coles charges different prices for the same product in different states. This would imply that Coles passes on supply chain costs to customers who are in areas further away from their main distribution centres. It may also give us a very general idea of where the main distribution centres are located. Insights gained from this analysis may provide a more granular picture of Coles' pricing strategy - which may be useful in formulating pricing and/or market segmentation strategies to compete with Coles.\n",
    "\n",
    "If price differences are not found between major cities and remote regions of Australia, that would imply that customers in major city centres are _de facto_ subsidising remote area customers' online purchases from Coles.\n",

    "* Unavailable Products are listed\n",
    "* Products listed as available have no price tags (i.e. it's actually unavailable but their system is either bugged or someone didn't make the correct changes on their internal system)\n",
    "* Duplicate products (i.e. same SKU from links with promotional suffix in the URL which escaped my scraper's filtering)\n",

The issue with the initial outputs was the fact that I had filtered out the \"unavailable\" products right at the start. After opening up the CSV files in Excel and viewing them, it turns out some of the products e.g. Budweiser does have the exact same list of suppliers but was listed as \"unavailable\" in Adelaide.\n",

The suppliers not found in the Melbourne stores were for all of the products which were also \"unavailable\" or not listed in the Melbourne store. It's highly likely that to be a supplier for Coles, one must have the capability to supply Nationally. However, since Coles lists a list of suppliers, it's possible that some of them only supply exclusively to one area."

    "There are 712 items with different prices. After adjusting for differences in the \"on special\" status, there are 690 items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 3 Categories account for 71.74% of the total items list:\n",
    "* Liquor                 25.4%\n",
    "* Drinks                 23.77%\n",
    "* Summer Entertaining    22.61%\n",
    "\n",
    "20 Brands (each of which account for more than 1% of the total) accounted for 50.58% of the list of items with different prices between Adelaide and Melbourne. The largest by far was Coles private label, at 15.65%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coles private label accounts for a significant proportion of products that are priced differently between Adelaide and Melbourne. This implies that Coles passes on all costs to the shoppers and their margins on these products are most likely uniform throughout Australia. This also implies that, potentially, some shoppers in certain regions of Australia are _de facto_ subsidising other shoppers when they purchase products with identical prices across different geographical locations in Australia. These products are likely not the most competitively priced in the marketplace and may be a potential area for competitor supermarkets to focus on exploiting. Another possibility is that Coles forces the suppliers to bear the \"subsidies\" for remote areas i.e. making a loss on the products in remote areas while making up the losses with larger profitable sales volume in metropolitan areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems most of the price difference are in the Liquor and Drinks category. The Summer Entertaining products are predominantly alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks - Cole's API only has one label for these products, even though they can be found in the Liquor or Drinks categories on their website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all other brands are all part of the portfolio of large global food and beverage companies - companies with market caps much bigger than Coles. This may explain why they are also able to price their products differently in different regions. I wouldn't be surprised if they are the ones dictating the terms to Coles.\n",
    "\n",
    "After filtering out products related to big beverage brands, random Colas or Sodas, and different bottles of water (Coles private label or otherwise), the biggest brand by far in the remaining list of items was Coles private brand - accounting for about 35% of that group."

    "As for why the vast majority of price differences are with bottle/canned beverages... I can only make some speculations. One thing that came to mind was the 10c refund label that you always find on bottles and cans. I never really looked into it but a quick look on [Wikipedia][] confirms that South Australia indeed _\"charges a refundable deposit of AUD 10 cents per drinks carton, can or bottle (only containers marked as eligible for refund; does not include wine & spirits bottles, milk cartons, or concentrated/and or vegetable juice intended to be diluted before consumption)\"._ It turns out this has been in place since 1977 and Victoria is expected to adopt a similar scheme by 2023, according to Wikipedia.\n",

Other products have a less than expected amount of difference e.g. Melbourne Bitters 375ml Can 6-pack only has a \\\\$1 difference. \n",
